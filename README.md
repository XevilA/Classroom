# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Using EAS for Building and Deployment

### ðŸ“¦ 1. Build an App
#### **iOS (Requires Mac & Xcode)**
```sh
eas build -p ios
```
- If you **don't have an Apple Developer account**, use `--profile development` to test locally.

#### **Android**
```sh
eas build -p android
```
- It will generate an `.apk` or `.aab` file for Android.

You can upload directly to the App Store or Google Play:

```sh
eas submit -p ios
```
```sh
eas submit -p android
```

#### âœ… **Share with QR Code**
